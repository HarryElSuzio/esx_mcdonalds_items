Made by Ashton - 1CAV - https://1stcavalry.org - Yes we are an ARMA3 unit but RP is life.

Add's Mcdonalds items as usable items in database and in game.

Uses esx_basicneeds by ESX Team. - https://github.com/ESX-Org/esx_basicneeds

Import the SQL file into your items table in the database.

Add start esx_mcdonalds_items to server.cfg after esx_basicneeds.

You will need to manually add these to shops, or create a McDonalds shop and add them to that.
